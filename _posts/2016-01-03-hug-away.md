Working with Billund Airport, students were asked to design a boarding pass as a postcard, which passengers could send from their vacation. To appeal to the passengers, experimental and untraditional methods such as computer programming and working with electronics were highly encouraged to help generate interesting graphics for the boarding pass.
Collaboration with Jules Banide, Silvia Bella, Tenna Jacobsen, and Denise JÃ¸rgensen at Designskolen Kolding.

Using Max/MSP and Phidget-sensors we developed an interactive application, based on data from movies we created of ink dispersing in water, to demonstrate how the hug illustration generator would work. We designed a pillow prototype to reflect the texture, feeling, and output of the final working installation.

Mockup of the potential installation in Billund Airport. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/88b7e61f-7366-4689-bebb-0dbfea81eaf5.jpg)

Continuous boarding pass pattern for functionality, fluidity, and design variation. The pattern coincides with the visuals generated by the hugging installation for consistency.

Boarding pass layout. The copy reads, "This is a visual hug, created by the warmth when you hug someone. Mail your hug between 1/10/12 and 1/1/13 to win tickets from Billund Airport. Visit facebook.com/pages/Billund-Airport for details."
