I am a curious communication designer inspired by the design opportunities that unfold at the intersection between multidisciplinary, collaborative processes. I am interested in creating engaging experiences for people, through design, to convey informative, visual stories within different spaces.

My main focus lies in the field of art and culture with a specialization in typography, layout, and printed matter, which drive my passion for details and nuances. I bring experience in publication, exhibition, and service design, as well as branding and visual identity. My background in graphic design and visual art form an increased awareness and adoption of alternative, versatile approaches within my design process, which convey a quiet intelligence across more meaningful, longer lasting solutions. I enjoy working in a dynamic hardworking environment where I can apply my design skills through hands-on, technical, and professional practice.
